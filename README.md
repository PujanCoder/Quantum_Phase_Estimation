⚡ Phase Kickback

Phase Kickback is a fundamental quantum computing phenomenon where the phase information of a unitary operator acting on a target qubit is “kicked back” to the control qubit of a controlled operation. Instead of directly observing the target qubit, the phase gets encoded into the control register, allowing algorithms like Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), Shor’s Algorithm, and Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to extract eigenvalues and periodicity efficiently.

In simple terms: the control qubit learns the phase of the operation applied to the target qubit — a key trick that gives quantum algorithms their exponential speedups.
